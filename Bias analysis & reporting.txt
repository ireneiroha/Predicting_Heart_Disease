Dataset: UCI Heart Disease Dataset (heart.csv)
Prepared by: Ethics & AI Governance Team
Date: June 8, 2025

üîç 1. Overview
The dataset in question contains 303 patient records used to predict the likelihood of heart disease. It includes 13 features representing demographic and clinical data, and a binary target variable (target), indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.

While the dataset is clinically rich, it lacks critical context related to geographical, socioeconomic, and ethnic diversity, which may significantly impact model performance, fairness, and applicability.

‚öñÔ∏è 2. Bias Evaluation
A. Demographic Bias
Feature	            Observed Imbalance	                         Implication
sex	                68.3% male, 31.7% female	                 Significant gender skew. Models may generalize poorly to female patients.
age	                Mean = 54.4 years, Min = 29, Max = 77	     Overrepresentation of middle-aged adults. Elderly and young patients underrepresented.

B. Diagnostic Access Bias
Several features (restecg, thalach, thal, oldpeak) assume the availability of advanced cardiac diagnostic tools (e.g., stress tests, ECGs), which may not be uniformly accessible:

Urban patients are more likely to have these tests performed.

Rural patients may be underrepresented, and models trained here could mispredict due to lack of such data.

C. Missing Socioeconomic and Geographic Features
No indicators of geographic origin, income, education, insurance status, or access to healthcare.

No proxy variables (e.g., hospital code, postal area) to infer urban vs rural classification.

As such, urban-rural bias cannot be measured directly but remains a critical concern given known disparities in cardiovascular care access.

üß† 3. Ethical Concerns
Concern	                          Description
Representational Harm	          Underrepresentation of certain populations (women, elderly, rural residents) may lead to misdiagnoses or lower-quality care.
Deployment Risk      	          Applying this model in rural, low-resource, or underserved populations without validation may worsen healthcare inequality.
Transparency & Explainability	  Features like thal and oldpeak are clinically relevant but may be missing in low-resource settings, making model predictions opaque and incomplete.
Regulatory Risk	                  Deployment of biased models in clinical settings could violate principles under AI regulations (e.g., FDA, EU AI Act), requiring fairness audits and impact assessments.

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Recommendations
Area	Recommendation
Data Collection	Enrich dataset with variables for location, race/ethnicity, income, and education level.
Sampling	Use stratified sampling or oversampling techniques to balance key demographics (gender, age).
Fairness Audits	Perform subgroup analysis (e.g., gender-specific ROC/AUC) and re-train models using fairness-aware algorithms.
Model Deployment	Limit initial deployment to populations similar to the dataset sample. Clearly document limitations and potential harms.
Clinical Input	Partner with rural health experts to validate model relevance and adjust for context-aware deployment.

‚úÖ 5. Conclusion
This dataset, while clinically informative, exhibits notable representational bias‚Äîespecially around gender, age, and diagnostic access. The absence of geographic and socioeconomic indicators limits the model‚Äôs fairness and raises ethical risks if used outside its original context.

A responsible AI pipeline must include bias audits, demographic balancing, and transparency before any real-world deployment.
